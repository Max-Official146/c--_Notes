<a>: This is called anchor element use to add link to web page
    But here it's only add text of an link
    Not connected to link yet

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">
    Link to Youtube

<!--
here we can add website link by using href=""
href="": It is a html attribute it define how an element behaves
"A mistake": <ahref> it is taken as element name not a attribute so 
    Give space like above

    href is attribute name and in "" are attribute value
    * If we don't use targrt attribute here the link open in same tab but now
      It open in a new tab by using the value "_blank"
